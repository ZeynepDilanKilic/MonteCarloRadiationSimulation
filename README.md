# MonteCarloRadiationSimulation
This repository contains a Monte Carlo simulation for measuring radiation permeability.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
2. Run the simulation script using your preferred method (e.g., `matlab simulation.m`).

## Project Structure

- `simulation.m`: The main script for the Monte Carlo simulation.
- `W_mu.txt`: Data file containing absorption coefficients.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
